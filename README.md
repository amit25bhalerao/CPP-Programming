# CPP Language Programs

This repository contains a collection of CPP (C++) language programs designed to help you learn and practice CPP programming concepts. Each program focuses on a specific topic or problem, providing a programming solution to demonstrate its implementation.

### Program Descriptions

1. Program 1: Axis Bank
   - Description: This program simulates a banking experience for a user, allowing them to perform various operations. It includes functionalities such as creating a user account, displaying user details, depositing an amount, and withdrawing an amount.
   - Programming Solution: [P1][p1]

2. Program 2: Factorial
   - Description: This program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. It demonstrates the recursive approach to solving the factorial problem.
   - Programming Solution: [P2][p2]

3. Program 3: Prime Numbers Between Range
   - Description: This program displays all the prime numbers within a user-defined interval or range. It helps in understanding how to identify and print prime numbers using loops and conditional statements.
   - Programming Solution: [P3][p3]

4. Program 4: Strong Number
   - Description: This program determines whether a given number is a strong number or not. A strong number is a number whose sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to the original number.
   - Programming Solution: [P4][p4]

## Usage

Each program is accompanied by a programming solution, which contains the code to implement the respective functionality. You can access the programming solutions by following the links provided in the table.

To run the programs, you can either compile them using a CPP compiler or use an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports CPP programming.
